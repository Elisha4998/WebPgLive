Advanced CSV generation from database manua:

CSV file location : C:\Users\personal_username\eclipse-workspace\package_name\
Database used : userregistration db used for login
Table used : usertable from userregistration db

Multiple tables can be created in one database and multiple tables from that database can be passed to export() in the program as a parameter to be converted into csv files.

If we update the database and run the program, the CSV file gets updated accordingly.
